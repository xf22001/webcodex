# Optional local Codex external observations (proposal #631)

This integration records bounded **external reports** in an explicitly selected
WebCodex Workflow Session. It does not install Hooks, change trust, create a
Session/Goal, execute commands, or migrate a conversation. The Server now projects
these claims read-only in `session_handoff_summary`; a local Codex recovery/export
consumer and Goal linkage remain follow-up work. This does not establish real
two-sided UI acceptance.

## Server contract

- `record_external_observation(project, session_id, adapter_id, event_id, observed_tool,
  exit_code?)`: exact authorized Project and Workflow Session; `session:collaborate`
  plus normal Project authority. A closed Session rejects new writes.
- `list_external_observations(project, session_id)`: authorized read of the same
  reports, available through normal MCP tool discovery/gateway and REST.

The write tool is intentionally adapter/API ingress and is hidden from the model
tool surface; `list_external_observations` remains model-visible for continuity
recovery. A model therefore cannot manufacture an external report through ordinary
MCP discovery while an authenticated local adapter can still submit one through the
supported Runtime API.

Both identities are required, not inferred from the connection, directory, window
or credentials. `adapter_id` and `event_id` are lowercase SHA-256 strings; they are
correlation keys, not authenticated provenance or authorization tokens. Any authorized
caller can submit claims, so output always identifies `provenance=external_report`.
Tool names are bounded ASCII identifiers; raw commands, arguments, stdout/stderr,
paths and transcript bodies are not inputs. Missing exit codes remain `unknown`;
provided codes become `reported_success` / `reported_failure`, never native Job or
validation verdicts. Reports do not update Goal progress or mark work complete.

A transaction commits the report and its deduplication identity together in the
existing Server database. Exact replay returns the stored observation, including
its original server timestamp; a changed tool/exit code conflicts. The key is scoped
to one Session and adapter. A write failure does not prove that no write occurred:
reconcile by submitting the **same** identity/payload, never rerunning work.

The prototype admits at most 256 observations per Session and 65,536 total. It
fails closed at capacity; it does not evict replay keys or silently claim full
history. There is no automatic garbage collection yet. This conservative capacity
policy and the final API shape need maintainer review before broad rollout. The
reported local operation is never represented as a native WebCodex tool/Job/validation
event, and the explicit ingestion/read calls are deliberately excluded from the
business Workflow Session event ledger so adapter traffic cannot evict native
execution evidence. The first adapter also has no durable source sequence: list
results therefore expose `coverage.complete=false` and do not claim complete capture
or source execution ordering. `session_handoff_summary` includes the last five
retained reports in `handoff_brief.external_observations`, with exact source IDs,
unknown count, truncation and explicit incomplete coverage. Use
`list_external_observations` to inspect all retained reports (at most 256).
Session lifecycle/authority remain owned by the existing Session store;
the SQLite table is only external evidence, not a second task state machine.

## Optional adapter (macOS / Linux, Python 3.10+)

After the user confirms the exact project and work, prepare one private configuration
**outside the project** with the exact canonical project root, existing Workflow
Session and local Codex conversation. Use normal supported host configuration and
trust approval; this repository does not install or approve the Hook automatically.
No production service or global configuration changes are necessary to review it.

```json
{
  "server_url": "https://webcodex.example.com",
  "authorization_file": "/private/operator/webcodex-authorization",
  "project": "agent:my-runner:my-project",
  "project_root": "/absolute/canonical/project",
  "workflow_session_id": "wc_sess_EXACT_EXISTING_SESSION",
  "local_session_id": "EXACT_LOCAL_CODEX_CONVERSATION",
  "state_dir": "/private/operator/observation-outbox"
}
```

Configuration and authorization files must be private regular single-link files
(mode 0600); authorization contains the deployment's existing full Authorization
header value. The pre-created outbox directory must be private (0700). Keep all
three outside the project so reading an untrusted checkout cannot change the target
or obtain credentials. This Unix adapter refuses symlink leaf files and redirects;
remote transport requires HTTPS. HTTP is accepted only for loopback. It uses the
configured origin directly, not ambient proxy settings. Windows support is deferred.

Configure a `PostToolUse` command through the client's normal supported Hooks flow:

```text
python3 /absolute/path/external_observation_hook.py --config /private/operator/observation.json
```

Expected Hook input: `hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, `tool_use_id`,
`tool_name`. Other fields, including tool input/output, are ignored. Input is bounded
to 128 KiB. Exact conversation/root matching happens before sending. The generic
adapter deliberately reports **unknown for every tool**, because free-text output
is not an authoritative execution receipt. Additional structured receipt recognition
must have separate, tool-specific tests.

A report is written/fsynced to the private outbox before transmission. On a missing
or mismatched acknowledgement it stays pending. Later invocations drain pending
reports within one bounded deadline, or the operator can explicitly run:

```text
python3 /absolute/path/external_observation_hook.py --config /private/operator/observation.json --flush
```

This retries observation storage only. It never runs business commands. A changed
configuration cannot retarget old pending reports. Conflicting/corrupt files remain
for diagnosis. At capacity or a concurrent adapter lock the command returns a visible
nonzero incomplete result; it does not claim the new event was captured. Completion
of the original native tool is independent of recording success. A client that does
not expose Hook failure cannot provide a complete capture guarantee.

## Verification boundary

Python unit tests use synthetic Hook payloads and controlled senders, including
uncertain delivery/retry, changed associations, private-file checks and redaction.
Rust tests cover transactional replay/reopen/conflict/capacity and authenticated
runtime dispatch. These do **not** establish real Codex Hook lifecycle or ChatGPT
browser acceptance of this proposed adapter. The separately deployed downstream
prototype's acceptance is not acceptance of these new endpoints.

Before rollout: in an isolated approved fixture, install/trust through the normal
client UI, bind the exact independent local conversation, perform a minimal real
read, verify one report through actual MCP, and retain `unknown` when no receipt is
available. Verify the wrong-project and offline cases separately. Do not exercise
this candidate against a production server that lacks the new endpoints.
